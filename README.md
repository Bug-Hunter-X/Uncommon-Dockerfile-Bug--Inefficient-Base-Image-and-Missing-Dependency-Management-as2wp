# Dockerfile Bug: Inefficient Base Image and Missing Dependency Management

This repository demonstrates a common but often overlooked issue in Dockerfiles: using unnecessarily large base images and failing to properly manage dependencies. This leads to bloated images, slow build times, and potential runtime issues.

## Bug Description

The provided `Dockerfile` uses `ubuntu:latest` as the base image. This image is very large and includes many packages that are likely not needed for a simple Python application.  Furthermore, it's missing key instructions to manage dependencies using a virtual environment and properly handle environment variables, leading to possible conflicts and unpredictable behavior.
